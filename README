# NagVis - Visualize monitoring data

NagVis is a program for visualizing the data the monitoring core of your choice,
for example Nagios, Naemon, Icinga or Shinken, in a human friendly way.

Instead of rendering all your data in flat tables of hosts and service data
which do not tell the user anything about relations between the object, in
NagVis you can create a view on your objects which makes even non technical
users understand the relations beteen your systems and services. This way
visualized it is easy for the users to realize which components are affected by
an occuring problem.

Besides manually created maps it is possible the create so called automaps
which visualize the parent/child relations between hosts or geomaps which
are meant to show objects based on the geographical coordinates. These
maps are currently only meant to be static, there is no browsing or zooming
possible like in Open Street Map or Google Maps.

## Installation

### OMD

There are different ways to install NagVis. The *best* way to an easily
maintainable monitoring environment is to use [OMD](http://omdistro.org), the
Open Monitoring Distribution. Everything you need comes in a single package.
You will be ready to monitor within just a couple of minutes.

### Manual installation

The *classic* way is to install NagVis is to use the installer script which
will ask you a couple of questions and then tries to do the right thing to
provide you with a working installation.

First you need to download NagVis. The released versions can be found on
[nagvis.org](http://nagvis.org/).

Unpack the archive to a temporary place (for example /tmp), then change to
that directory.

```
# tar xvzf nagvis-1.*.tar.gz /tmp
# cd /tmp/nagvis-1.*
```

Now execute the installer and follow the instructions.

```
# ./install.sh
```

Once you are finished with the installer, you can remove the source directory.

```
# rm -rf /tmp/nagvis-1.*
```

*Hint:* The installer can be called with command line parameters to e.g.
avoid interactive questions during installation. For details launch the
installer with the `-h` option.
