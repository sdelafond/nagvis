    <h1>Authorisation Module: Groups</h1>
    <p>NagVis uses an own user, role and permission management in current versions. However,
    since the authorisation is modularized, it is possible to use alernative authorisation modules.</p>
    <p>Since NagVis 1.8b1 there is a new auhthorisation module shipped with NagVis named <tt>CoreAuthorisationModGroups</tt>.
    It makes use of the contact groups defined in your monitoring core and a mapping table, which is NagVis specific,
    to gather the permissions of the users within NagVis. Please note that this new feature can only be used when using
    the livestatus backend.</p>
    
    <p>To use this module each user which should get access to NagVis has to have a contact with a matching
    name defined in your monitoring core. You also need to assign at least one contact group to this contact.</p>

    <p>When you have defined your contacts, contact groups and the memberships within your core, you can start
    creating the mapping table which maps the contact group names to NagVis permissions.</p>

    <p>The mapping table is configured using a JSON construct within the file <tt>nagvis/etc/perms.db</tt>.
    This JSON contruct is an object which uses the contact group names as keys which each refer to a nested
    object which contains the permissions assigned to each member of this group.</p>
    <p>

    <p>Here you can see the contents of the example configuration:</p>
    <pre>{
  "admins": {
    "admin": 1
  },
  "first_level_support": {
    "view": [ "*" ]
  },
  "power_users": {
    "view": [ "*" ],
    "edit": [ "*" ]
  },
  "oracle_admins": {
    "view": [ "oracle_servers" ],
    "edit": [ "oracle_servers" ]
  }
}
</pre>

    <p>In the example above all members of the contact group "admins" get full access to NagVis including 
    all permissions. The contact group named "first_level_support" gets view access to all maps defined in NagVis.
    The contact group named "power_users" gets view and edit permissions to all maps.
    The contact group named "oracle_admins" is allowed to view and edit the map named "oracle_servers".</p>
